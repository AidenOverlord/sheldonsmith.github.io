       <center>The things that I would consider my strengths aren’t really seen as such by my pairs or parents if I’m being honest but they are to me. I’m very good at disconnecting , this has helped me so much in my life where I’m either too invested or I’ve been left behind abruptly. I’m great at observing and picking up things that other wont and this has helped me navigate the hellscape called high school as I was always able to see people for who they really are and so far in university it has proven useful as people don’t change. Lastly, I’m extremely great at adapting , accept and adapt , so set backs and failures don’t stop be. It’s like have an “It is what it is attitude”… just got to keep it pushing and hope for a turn around.

        The Tweleve Pillars is a great book that teaches about life experiences.
    </p>
    <h2>The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it. >> Pillar #4 << </h2>
    <p>
        The goal is to decide where you would like to go and then to plan for it. It will lead you to a future you want to achieve by setting goals that extend you and make you do things differently, such as having a backup plan in mind. 
        <br>I've set myself a variety of goals, from school to work and this chapter of books teaches that there are many options if the first plan doesn't always work.
    </p>
    <h2>Everyday has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity. >> Pillar #5 << </h2>
    <p>
        We all have two pains: a disciplinary pain or a regrettable pain. The distinction is that discipline weighs tons of weight and regret. You have the best chance each day to match your overall objectives and spend your time. Don't just pass the day, get from the day. Don't spend time with urgency, spend time with what is important. 
        <br> I realize that it’s okay to make mistakes and how to choose the opportunity of my struggle.
    </p>
    <h2>Don’t join an easy crowd; you wont grow. Go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high. >> Pillar #6 << </h2>
    <p>
        This concept is interesting. It is easier to keep some people for friends rather than to look for new friends. Successful people are looking for relationships with successful people who push, challenge and encourage them to improve. You need to be attractive to attractive people. Not in physical terms but in mind, and who are you.
        <br>I've push myself and think about whats best for me and met with some great people who encourage one another in fulfilling their dreams.
    </p>
    <h2> Formal education will make you a living.  Self education will make you a fortune. >> Pillar #7 << </h2>
    <p>
        People learn how to self-educate yourself. This is what you learn along the way to improve and to grow constantly. Many people do not keep learning and growing, separating themselves from others, focusing on continuing learning.
        <br>I try to integrate self-study into my day-to-day life. Not everything will be taught in school, you have to learn about your life on your own.
    </p>
    <h2>One key to having influence with others is to have others perceive you as a person of talent and virtue. >> Pillar #8 <<</h2>
    <p>
        Sales is really simply the application of influence, and that is a knowledge in life that we must all have to achieve what we desire and want. Talent and virtue are the basis for successful influence and a successful sales, regardless if you sell or sell a product – and you always sell a successful person.
        <br>I believe whether on the job, at home or on the road I see it as important for you to be seen by the people as a prefect choice to perform a role or to do a task.
